 # Step 3: Sea Bins
 
 Lastly, let's make sure that any plactic that reaches the water doesn't end up floating out to the ocean.
 
 Sea bins clean up plastics and other harmful waste from the water. Surrounding waste flows into the bin while water is pumped out the bottom trapping any waste in a filter.
 
 * Callout(**Did You Know**):
 Almost 9 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. Estimates state that 90% of all sea birds have already eaten some kind of plastic.
