 # Phase 3: Sea Bins
 
 Sea bins clean up plastics and other harmful waste from the ocean. Surrounding waste flows into the bin while water is pumped out the bottom trapping any waste in a filter.
 
 **Did you know:** Almost 9 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. It's been estimated that 90% of all sea birds have eaten some kind of plastic.
